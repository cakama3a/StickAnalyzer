## Features

Stick Analyzer offers a robust set of tools to analyze joystick performance:

- **Precision Measurement**: Tracks stick movement from center to edge, capturing fine-grained displacement data to evaluate resolution and accuracy.
- **Linearity Analysis**: Calculates nonlinearity and linearity percentages to assess how closely stick movement matches an ideal linear path.
- **Tremor Detection**: Identifies inconsistencies in stick movement, quantifying tremor as a percentage to highlight potential hardware issues.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays live stick movement with a graphical interface, guiding users through calibration and testing phases.
- **Detailed Statistics**: Provides metrics such as test duration, total data points, resolution, and step resolution for in-depth analysis.
- **Data Export**: Saves raw test data to text files and generates visual plots using Matplotlib for easy review.
- **Online Submission**: Optionally submits results to [gamepadla.com](https://gamepadla.com) for sharing and further analysis, with automatic browser opening to view results.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux (with compatible controllers and dependencies).
