Key features of Stick Analyzer:

1. Stick Resolution Measurement: The program prompts the user to slowly move the stick from the center to the edge, recording the displacement values at each step. After that, Stick Analyzer determines the smallest distance between the recorded points, which represents the stick's resolution.
2. Detailed Statistics: In addition to the direct resolution value, Stick Analyzer provides detailed statistics, including the average, minimum, and maximum distances between points, as well as the total number of points recorded during the test.
3. Value Frequency Analysis: The program performs a frequency analysis of each unique distance value between points, determining which value occurs most often, as well as the percentage of occurrences for each value out of the total count.
4. Convenient Data Output: The test results are displayed in a user-friendly and clearly structured format, providing easy access to key resolution metrics and statistical data for users.
